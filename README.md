Smartlink addresses one of the biggest challenges in the global marketplace: ‘Need to Trust,’ by introducing decentralized escrow services and payments processing based on Tezos' institutional-grade smart contracts that suppress the need for buyers and sellers to trust each other.

Smartlink aims to provide a user-centered escrow solution to secure online and face-to-face transactions while broadening payments acceptance options through integrated wrapped currencies.

Smartlink proposes a new method to initiate commercial transactions by offering Trust-As-A-Service to incentivize commitment and eliminate the trust deficit in the global marketplace.
